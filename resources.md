## Product Management
It's not easy for many to define what a product manger does. I like Ken Norton's definition: "a technical, user-focused team leader working closely with engineers and designers to guide products". His [guide on how to hire product managers](https://www.bringthedonuts.com/essays/productmanager.html) doubles as a way to prepare for interviews. 

The seminal book in the space has to be Marty Cagan's [Inspired](https://www.amazon.com/INSPIRED-Create-Tech-Products-Customers/dp/1119387507).

From the perspective of an investor-founder, Michael Seibel breaks down [building products at start ups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C27RVio2rOs) with incredible clarity.

If you follow one product person on twitter make it [Shreyas Doshi](https://twitter.com/shreyas).

A lot of product training is probably over priced garbage, [Jeff Patton's course](https://jpattonassociates.com/) is not, it's excellent.

### Writing
Good writing is indistinguishable from good thinking.

[*The Sense of Style*](https://stevenpinker.com/publications/sense-style-thinking-persons-guide-writing-21st-century) defines style and how to develop a classical style. If you have less time, watch the [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZKTmsgqi0U).

[*Writing Down the Bones*](https://nataliegoldberg.com/books/writing-down-the-bones/) by Natalie Goldberg, taught me about the habit of writing.

Paul Graham is sharp about many things including [writing](http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html).

Jordan Peterson's guide to [writing essays](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://jordanbpeterson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Essay_Writing_Guide.docx) explains why and how to write essays.

David Perell translates writing into the 21st century, follow his [twitter](https://twitter.com/david_perell).

## Machine Learning

Learning the field of Machine Learning has been rewarding and challenging. Here are some useful resources:

["Learn python the hard way"](https://learnpythonthehardway.org) follows the philosophy that the hard way is the easy way. They're right.

[A primer](https://elitedatascience.com/primer) that provides a broad framework for data science.

[machinelearningmastery.com](https://machinelearningmastery.com) teaches machine learning with a similar philosophy to learning python the hard way. 

Much thinking on AI ethics is shallow, [Vervaeke](https://a.co/d/74PrAf2) is anything but. 

You'll probably need access to some data:
