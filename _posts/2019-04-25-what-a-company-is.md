A company has various levels of control: hypothesis, strategy, management, activity. Hypothesis forms strategy, strategy directs management, management molds activity, good activity creates good companies.

**Hypothesis**  
At the heart of all good companies is a hypothesis about why anyone should invest themselves into that company e.g. Coke’s hypothesis says “Coke is the best Cola.” Pepsi’s hypothesis says “Some people prefer Pepsi.” Any threat to this hypothesis, is an existential crisis for the company (Coke changed their recipe briefly). Your business also has a hypothesis at its heart. The hypothesis explains why people should spend your limited time and energy on this endeavor: you, your customer, your employees, your investors.

Inherent to your hypothesis is an understanding of the customer, a problem, a solution, and a business model. Innovation happens when your hypothesis gets disrupted, or when someone else in the market has a stale hypothesis and you come along to change the game. e.g. Virgin Airlines innovated by disrupting a stale hypothesis. The stale airline hypothesis said: 1) our customers view flight as a novelty, 2) the problem is that flying can feel dangerous, 3) the solution is to build a strong brand, 4) the business model involves charging premium prices for premium service.

Virgin noticed that the hypothesis had changed. Customers now saw flights as a commodity, and the problem for customers was finding the cheapest flight not the most established brand. Airlines were suffering by not updating their hypothesis they fought a continual uphill battle. Virgin innovated. They changed their business model to match the changing hypothesis. Instead of fighting price sensitivity, they reduced the overhead of maintaining an airline. Ironically, in the process they re-introduced a (temporary) measure of brand loyalty.

**Strategy**  
Once you have your hypothesis clear, the first existential problem of your company is solved (for now). The second one dealing with competition through good strategy. A good strategy crystallizes an accurate understanding of your company’s strengths and weaknesses, as well as your competitors. A strategy directs the efforts of your company so that your weaknesses are defended and your strengths overcome your competitors.

A good strategy should have no more than 1 - 3 focuses. Strategy that changes too often de-coheres your company, weakening it. Strategy that doesn’t change enough will not adapt and eventually lose. At my first start up, we sold software to companies that allowed them to manage the applications on their employees’ phones. Our strength was that our software worked even if the company didn’t control the phone that it ran on. Our weakness was in companies where it was ok that the company controlled the employees’ phones. Our strategy was to pursue companies that did business through partners, resellers, or distributors. It was a strategy that allowed us to generate enough business to be funded and later acquired.

**Management**  
Management is an art that must both maintain the company and execute on its strategy. Management is impossible to assess if strategy is weak. Sales management in particular is judged for a number that it may or may not be able to control. Sales management should be judged on its ability to accurately assess clients where strategic advantage holds, and then on its ability to win those clients where the company has a strategic advantage - in short, their ability to direct resources intelligently, and to win the clients that they should. Too often sales management is simply assessed on its ability to increase revenue, which only serves to hide weak strategy.

There are a couple books I’ve seen about management that have greatly informed the way that I think about management:

1. [*Mastering the Rockefeller Habits*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005J386GS/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) by Verne Harnish outlines three tasks management must do: establish priorities, look at data, and drive a rhythm of meetings that maintain alignment and accountability. This has formed the basic structure of management for all my teams in the past five years.

2. [*High Output Management*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015VACHOK/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) by Andrew Grove. No book better breaks down what it is to control the output of a company. He defines management in the most basic manner: to first increase the product of your team, and second to increase the productivity of the teams connected to your team.

3. [*TopGrading*](https://www.topgrading.com/) by Bradford Smart the book isn't well reviewed but all you need is the interviewing guide. I’ve used a stripped down version of the CIDS interview to both make and attract top hires.  

**Action**  
At the level of action each employee ought to strive to take the right actions with the right attitudes (idea stolen from Bill Walsh, coach of the legendary 49ers teams). This is how we bring meaning to our work as individuals. Each person is responsible for placing themselves well and taking pride in what they do. When we do the right things with the right attitude, we set an example for others around us, and we set an example for ourselves (i.e. we tend to do better in other areas of our lives).
