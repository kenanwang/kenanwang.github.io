title: Enron Anomaly Detection using Neural Network Analysis
categories: [End to End Projects]
tags: [Hopfield Memory Network, Network Analysis, NetworkX]
---
In this project I am replicating analysis from a research paper found below. This project maps a social network as a neural network, precisely a Hopfield memory network. We feed the Hopfield memory network features that represent anomalously high amounts of activity. We use a Hebbian learning rule to train our memory network. The Hebbian rule "remembers" nodes that fire together.  Thus, our memory network algorithm takes the input data of individuals who are displaying elevated activity, and extracts an even more precise signal of specific subnetworks of elevated activity occurring together.  

I use the Enron Corpus, found here: https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/enron-email-dataset, to try to replicate the analysis from this paper:

Volodymyr Miz, Benjamin Ricaud, Kirell Benzi, and Pierre Vandergheynst. 2019. Anomaly detection in the dynamics of web and social networks. In Proceedings of May 13-17 (TheWebConf 2019). , 10 pages. https://doi.org/10.475/123_4

Thanks to Volodymyr Miz who generously helped me troubleshoot my analysis and who has many helpful [online resources](http://blog.miz.space/research/2019/02/13/anomaly-detection-in-dynamic-graphs-and-time-series-networks/) to understand the research as well.

They were able to detect four periods of anamoly within the corpus data by treating the social network of email communications as a Hopfield Memory Network. They start by building a graph of email addresses as nodes and emails sent as edges. The attributes of the graph they built are described more specifically here:
https://zenodo.org/record/1342353#.Xap5medKjMJ

They use this paper to as the ground level truth that they compare their four periods of anamalous activity against:
Heng Wang, Minh Tang, Youngser Park, and Carey E Priebe. 2014. Locality statistics for anomaly detection in time series of graphs. IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing 62, 3 (2014), 703â€“717.

In order to better understand how to clean the data I also followed:

Shetty, Jitesh & Adibi, Jafar. (2004). The Enron email dataset database schema and brief statistical report. http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.296.9477&rep=rep1&type=pdf

The graph generated by Miz, Ricaud, Benzi, Vandergheynst (2019), had 6600 nodes and 50,897 edges. I wasn't able to perfectly duplicate this result, but in order to get close I had to do things like drop automatically sent emails and I had to drop some duplicated emails as in Shetty, Adibi (2004). The day numbers differ slightly between our two sets as well (by 3 days), I'm not sure why this is. In the next part I will use both my data and the data provided by Miz, Ricaud, Benzi, Vandergheynst (2019) to perform the ML analysis.

Note: Turns out that the reason my data is off is because I kept all emails that either sent or received 3 emails. Miz, Ricaud, Benzi, Vandergheynst (2019) only kept nodes that sent 3 emails. I'm going to use their data from now moving forward. But this was a good exercise. Below I import their data.


```python
nodes_df = pd.read_csv('nodes.csv', header=None, names=['node_dict'], index_col=0)
edges_df = pd.read_csv('edges.csv')
print(nodes_df.head())
print(edges_df.head())
```

# II. Implementing Algorithms from Paper

Miz, Ricaud, Benzi, Vandergheynst (2019) treats the social network of people sending emails at Enron as a graph where the nodes represent email addresses (that sent more than 3 emails during the time in question) and edges exist between email addresses if an email was ever sent between the email addresses.

This graph (which represents a social network) is then treated like a memory network. Specifically the network is a Hopfield memory network using the Hebbian learning rule. A Hopfield network stores memories (and can be recalled in using partial informatino). The Hebbian rule creates memories when nodes (neurons) fire together, in this case an abnormal level of emailing is what is registered as a neuron firing.

Miz, Ricaud, Benzi, Vandergheynst (2019) go through 4 stages of when implementing the algorithm just described:

- They extract features by finding abnormal bursts of emails from one person. These basically correspond in future steps to a "neuron firing" within the memory field.

- They train Hopfield memory fields from those bursts using the Hebbian rule, which means connected people sending abnormally higher levels of emails together gets trained into the field as a "memorable event". A new Hopfield memory field is trained each month in this case, so they're attempting to learn new "memories" each month.

- They explore the Hopfield memory fields from certain months and look for the largest connected subgraph from that memory field and treat that as a "memorable" co-occurence of abnormally high email behavior

- They look at that subgraph of people and analyze their email volume to confirm that there is in fact an anomaly of emails during that time, this is compared to four events that happened in real life where higher email traffic would be expected

## II.a. Extract features and filter nodes


```python
# This generates an array displaying the time series activity of each node in the rows of the array
# This matrix of time series activity will be used to generate the mean and std of activity for each time step
def gen_signal_array(G, t_min=0, t_max=1448):
    nodes = G.nodes(data=True)
    signal_array = np.zeros(shape=(len(nodes),t_max+1-t_min))
    for t in range(t_min, t_max+1):
        for node, data in nodes:
            signal_array[node][t-t_min] = data.get(t,0)
    return signal_array
```


```python
# From the matrix of time series activity this function generates the mean and std of each time step
def gen_means_and_stds(signal_array):
    means = np.apply_along_axis(np.mean, 0, signal_array)
    stds = np.apply_along_axis(np.std, 0, signal_array)
    return means, stds
```


```python
# Keep only nodes that have bursts above a certain minimum number of bursts
# Only keep activity that is anamolous (a burst)
# A burst is defined as activity in a time step a certain number of STDs above the mean for that timestep
def filter_potential_anomalies(G, t_min, t_max, burst_threshold, min_bursts):
    signal_array = gen_signal_array(G, t_min, t_max)
    means, stds = gen_means_and_stds(signal_array)
    nodes = G.nodes
    nodes_to_keep = []
    activity = {}
    for node, node_dict in nodes.items():
        bursts = 0
        activity_to_keep = {}
        #freq = 0
        total = 0
        for t in range(t_min, t_max+1):
            if node_dict.get(t,0)>0:
                total+=node_dict[t]
                #freq+=1
                #activity_to_keep[t] = node_dict[t]
        for t in range(t_min, t_max+1):
            if node_dict.get(t,0) > means[t-t_min] + stds[t-t_min]*burst_threshold:
                bursts+=1
                activity_to_keep[t] = node_dict[t]
        if bursts >= min_bursts:
            nodes_to_keep.append(node)
            activity[node] = dict([(k, v/total) for k,v in activity_to_keep.items()])
    #H=G.subgraph(nodes_to_keep)
    H = nx.Graph()
    H.add_nodes_from(G.subgraph(nodes_to_keep).nodes)
    H.add_edges_from(G.subgraph(nodes_to_keep).edges)
    nx.set_node_attributes(H, activity)
    return H
```

Using the above function I extract features. In this case the features are the nodes with enough potentially anomalous activity as well as the potentially anomalous activity itself. By filtering out only these nodes and this activity I am extracting the useful features that will be used for training later with the Hopfield memory network.


```python
# December graph
G_dec = filter_potential_anomalies(G_mapped, t_min=330, t_max=361, burst_threshold=3, min_bursts=2)
```


```python
print(nx.number_of_nodes(G_dec))
print(nx.number_of_edges(G_dec))
```

```python
# April graph
G_apr = filter_potential_anomalies(G_mapped, t_min=818, t_max=848, burst_threshold=5, min_bursts=3)
```


```python
print(nx.number_of_nodes(G_apr))
print(nx.number_of_edges(G_apr))
```

```python

G_may = filter_potential_anomalies(G_mapped, t_min=848, t_max=886, burst_threshold=5, min_bursts=3)
```


```python
print(nx.number_of_nodes(G_may))
print(nx.number_of_edges(G_may))
```

```python
# August graph
G_aug = filter_potential_anomalies(G_mapped, t_min=940, t_max=971, burst_threshold=6, min_bursts=3)
```


```python
print(nx.number_of_nodes(G_aug))
print(nx.number_of_edges(G_aug))
```

def train_hopfield(G, min_time, max_time, sparsity_parameter=0.5, forgetting_parameter=0):
    H = G.copy()
    edges = H.edges
    edge_weights = {}

        node_dict_j = G.nodes(data=True)[j]
        edge_weights[(i,j)] = 0
        # Train by stepping through time and use Hebbian learning rule (using the similarity function defined)
        for t in range(min_time, max_time+1):
            activities = (node_dict_i.get(t,0), node_dict_j.get(t,0))
            if activities == (0,0):
                sim[(i,j,t)] = 0
            else:
                sim[(i,j,t)] = min(activities)/max(activities)
            if sim[(i,j,t)] > sparsity_parameter:
                edge_weights[(i,j)] += sim[(i,j,t)]
            else:
                edge_weights[(i,j)] -forgetting_parameter*sim[(i,j,t)]
    nx.set_edge_attributes(H, name='weight', values=edge_weights)
    return H
```


```python
# Filter out edges with low weight in the Hopfield Memory Network
def filter_edges_by_weight(G, weight_limit=0):
    H = G.copy()
    to_remove = []
    edges = H.edges(data=True)
    for i, j, data in edges:
        if data['weight'] <= weight_limit:
            to_remove.append((i,j))
    H.remove_edges_from(to_remove)
    return H
```

Below we train the Hopfield memory networks for each month, we filter out the low weight edges, after that we look for the largest connected subgraph in the trained network. Hypothetically this would represent a group of people all connected together who are simultaneously (we know it's simultaneous because we're using a Hebbian learning rule) displaying anomalous activity. Such a cluster would likely display the most interesting activity of all people within that month.


```python
# Training the Hopfield network for December 1999 (first anomaly)
G_trained_dec = train_hopfield(G_dec, min_time=330, max_time=361)
```


```python
# Finding the largest connected component subgraph of the trained Graph for December
G_trained_dec_filtered = filter_edges_by_weight(G_trained_dec)
Gc_dec = max(nx.connected_component_subgraphs(G_trained_dec_filtered), key=len)
print(nx.number_of_nodes(Gc_dec))
```

    45



```python
# Training the Hopfield network for April 2001 (second anomaly)
G_trained_apr = train_hopfield(G_apr, min_time=818, max_time=848)
```


```python
# Finding the largest connected component subgraph of the trained Graph for December
G_trained_apr_filtered = filter_edges_by_weight(G_trained_apr, weight_limit=1)
Gc_apr = max(nx.connected_component_subgraphs(G_trained_apr_filtered), key=len)
print(nx.number_of_nodes(Gc_apr))
```

    38



```python
# Training the Hopfield network for May 2001 (third and biggest anomaly)
G_trained_may = train_hopfield(G_may, min_time=848, max_time=886)
```


```python
# Finding the largest connected component subgraph of the trained Graph for May 2001
G_trained_may_filtered = filter_edges_by_weight(G_trained_may, weight_limit=1)
Gc_may = max(nx.connected_component_subgraphs(G_trained_may_filtered), key=len)
print(nx.number_of_nodes(Gc_may))
```

    54



```python
# Training the Hopfield network for Aug 2001 (fourth anomaly)
G_trained_aug = train_hopfield(G_aug, min_time=940, max_time=971)
```


```python
# Finding the largest connected component subgraph of the trained Graph for May 2001
G_trained_aug_filtered = filter_edges_by_weight(G_trained_aug)
Gc_aug = max(nx.connected_component_subgraphs(G_trained_aug_filtered), key=len)

## III. Analysis of Anomalous Clusters

Now that we've found the anamolous cluster of people for each month let's confirm that their activity is quantitatively interesting. One way of doing this is comparing the cumulative activity of the people within an anamolous cluster for their month of interest vs their activity at all other times.


```python
def gen_activity_graph(G_original, cluster, t_min=0, t_max=1448):
    original_times = []
    for node, node_dict in cluster.nodes(data=True):
        for t,v in node_dict.items():
            original_times.append(t)
    cluster = G_original.subgraph(cluster)
    time = range(t_min, t_max+1)
    array = np.zeros(shape=(len(time)))
    for t in time:
        for _, node_dict in cluster.nodes(data=True):
            array[t-t_min]+=node_dict.get(t,0)
    plt.plot(array)
    plt.axvspan(min(original_times),max(original_times),color='red', alpha=0.3)
    return array
```


```python
dec_array = gen_activity_graph(G_mapped, Gc_dec)
```

The anamolous cluster of people for December 1999 indeed sent notably more emails in December 1999 (highlighted in red) than at any other time. At this time Enron was attempting to push through a deal with the help of Merrill-Lynch before the end of their financial quarter. This activity has since been [investigated by regulators](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/04/business/1999-transaction-with-enron-keeps-dogging-merrill-lynch.html).


```python
apr_array = gen_activity_graph(G_mapped, Gc_apr)
```


![png](output_52_0.png)


The anamolous cluster of people for April 2001 indeed sent notably more emails in April 2001 (highlighted in red) than at any other time. This corresponds with the time period when Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling was [publically questioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal#Timeline_of_downfall) about their earnings.


```python
may_array = gen_activity_graph(G_mapped, Gc_may)
```


![png](output_54_0.png)


The anamolous cluster of people for May 2001 indeed sent notably more emails in May 2001 (highlighted in red) than at any other time. This corresponds with "formal notice of closure and termination of Enronâ€™s single largest foreign investment, the Dabhol
Power Company in India." (Heng Wang, Minh Tang, Youngser Park, and Carey E Priebe. 2014.)


```python
aug_array = gen_activity_graph(G_mapped, Gc_aug)
```

My August cluster does not seem to display anamolous activity in the time series quantitative data as clearly as the data produced by Miz, Ricaud, Benzi, Vandergheynst (2019) I seem to be producing a similar signal for august but I have a lot of additional noise in other time periods that they do not. I'm not quite able to diagnose why this is the case but my algorithm is perfectly capable of finiding the signal from the noise in the other months. What follows is an analysis of the difference in the nodes between my data and the official data for the month of August.  

August 2001 is when Enron CEO, Jeffrey Skilling, resigned.


```python
id_email = pd.read_csv('id-email.csv', header=None, names=['id','email'], index_col='id')
id_email.head()
```

I have overlap between my April and August email clusters. This same phenomenon does not occur in the official data. This would explain some of the noise in my august data, although it's still not clear what about my algorithm is causing this.
