Companies must make decisions about what to build in their products and what not to build. What allows for good decisions? Memory, communication, learning feedback, and direction. When a team and a product are small enough the team implicitly and organically remembers all the relevant experiences, speaks the same language, hears the same feedback, and moves in the same direction. But when either the team or the product grow past a certain stage memory has to be recorded to be shared, language must be pruned to be useful, feedback must be sought and delivered, direction has to be discussed.

Product management delivers decisions. But the day to day task of a product manager consists of delineating disparate knowledge and implicit logic that is distributed across a team or outside the team with the customer. What you want is a framework for making decisions that 1) allows you to make decisions, 2) allows relevant people to contribute to decisions, 3) makes all relevant people better at making decisions.

At the Wikimedia foundation the biggest questions at the heart of our product organization was why the number of active editors for Wikipedia had been in decline since 2007. There were two main possibilities for the decline in active editors that we could identify. The first was ease of use, Wikipedia was older technology and had an older user interface. The second was an unwelcoming community of existing editors more concerned with maintenance than growth.

In my time at Wikimedia as the mobile product manager we launched the ability to edit from mobile. The launch of mobile web editing saw the first significant sustained increase in active editors since 2007. This was incredibly exciting even on its own; but, even more importantly I received crucial feedback from this launch. The feature that we launched at first was minimal and not built with a modern user interface, it still succeeded. What was one major difference? Mobile users we relatively insulated from the existing community of editors. The feedback that I received pointed to deprioritizing user interface changes and prioritizing interventions on community interactions.

This is the kind of feedback that was not only crucial for me and my team, this was the kind of feedback that was crucial for the whole company. A significant part of my job became about analyzing this phenomenon, recording it, communicating about it, seeking more feedback (data) about whether this learning was correct, and then talking through how this would affect our team’s and the company’s direction.

Product roadmaps, user studies, feature estimation and prioritization, company talks, customer office hours – all of these are ways of improving the memory, communication, learning feedback, and direction within a product team. There isn’t a lot of structure to a product manager’s job day to day – but thinking about how to accomplish tasks in these four areas is the path to better decisions.
