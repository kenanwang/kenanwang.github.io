Personalization is a major product opportunity for many businesses today. This is a product analysis of personalization opportunities for Crunchbase following this format:
* Company opportunity
* User personas
* Salesperson pain points
* Potential Solutions for “Finding Prospects”

It starts broad and narrows down toward recommending personalization based solutions for the pain points in one step of the user journey for one of the user personas.

## Company Opportunity
Crunchbase is the \#1 database of companies. However, data is a commodity business. By moving vertically toward owning the user, Crunchbase can capture more loyalty and deliver more value by helping users process that data. User personas allow Crunchbase to customize data to fit use cases. As users demonstrate interest and accumulate successes, Crunchbase also has the opportunity to personalize data for users.

Data -> APIs -> Applications -> Customization for Personas -> Personalization for User

## User Personas
Crunchbase has five main users. Below are short personas for user, followed by an analysis of the opportunity size for each.

Salespeople make a living by:
* making connections
* building confidence (and trust)
* navigating buying processes

Considerations for salespeople:
* high stress job
* variety of technical aptitude
* willing to pay for a competitive edge

Investors make a living by:
* identifying good founders and companies
* timing good investments
* helping founders and companies survive and grow

Considerations for investors:
* high noise to signal ratio
* big variety in investor models (early, late, verticalized, by founder, etc.)
* ignorance is death (any one of many variables can sink a deal)

Founders make a living by:
* finding a problem to solve
* being resourceful to survive
* learning (and executing) like mad to grow

Considerations for founders:
* sub-personas: enterprise and consumer
* you miss every shot you don’t take (i.e. favor execution)
* more founders than ever (even, maybe especially, after the pandemic)

Job seekers need:
* find opportunities
* get noticed
* prove their experience and abilities

Considerations for job seekers:
* sub-personas: have a job and looking vs. no job
* selling yourself for a job is increasingly complex (job type, vertical, technologies, location, etc.)
* market instability -> more demand for jobs

Market researchers make a living by:
* aggregating information
* surfacing insights
* discovering interesting patterns quickly

Considerations for market researchers:
* sub-personas: external vs. internal
* speed matters i.e. if people already know about the trend you are surfacing then you aren’t providing value
* accuracy matters i.e. you’re only trusted as a researcher if you can surface accurate information

|  | Crunchbase value add | Market Size | Level of Effort |
|-|-|-|-|
| Salespeople | L (CB can help almost every step of the B2B sale) | XL | L (integration to CRM etc.) |
| Investors | XL (nothing more important than being informed) | S | S to M (closest to current UX) |
| Founders | L (finding investors is often critical, competitor info helps your company learn) | M | M (two sub-personas: enterprise and consumer) |
| Job seekers | M (many solutions on the market place but the data on CB can help w/ complexity of job searching) | L  | M (relatively different from current UX, but use case isn’t as complex as some others) |
| Market researchers | L (there are other sources of info, but CB is the #1 company database) | M | M two sub-personas: external and internal) |

## Salesperson Pain Points
In order to identify user problems for salespeople that personalization can solve, we can look at two different processes, and identify user pain points along the way:
1. The work process of a B2B salesperson i.e. B2B sales cycle
2. The life cycle of a salesperson who becomes a customer of Crunchbase

### B2B Sales Cycle
1. Find prospects

*Pain points: Display, or rank higher in searches, relevant prospects based on:*
- *Companies similar to ones they are interested in*
- *Companies similar to ones they’ve sold to in the past*
- *Their stated interests, industry, business, etc.*

2. Contact people

*Give initial communications a more personalized feel by targeting them to the specific:*
- *company*
- *department*
- *team*
- *person*

*For example, if Ed, a sales person, wanted to contact Mary in the marketing department at Pepsi, Crunchbase can help Ed might want to know that Mary’s boss’s boss is Shelly, that Shelly recently replaced the last VP of Western U.S. Marketing, and that Shelly has been hired to place a particular emphasis on digital marketing, especially on streaming video.*

3. Qualify

*Sales people need to know:*
- *If they’re talking to the right people*
- *If there is a fit between what the customer needs and what you are providing*
- *If the company has the budget*

4. Nurture

*Salespeople need opportunities to:*
- *Show an active interest in the companies they are selling to*
- *See changes that might be a reason for the deal to move forward faster*
- *See changes that might threaten a deal*

5. Sales presentation

*Salespeople wish to be prepared for their sales presentations:*
- *Speak to the company’s, department’s, team’s, person’s core mission, problems, strategy, etc.*
- *Know who will be in the room*
- *Be able to talk to the lead about what’s newly on their minds*

6. Overcome objections

*Salespeople need to be able to get past these types of “No”s:*
- *Not right now: by building urgency*
- *Vacillation and price objection: by hitting a stronger pain point*
- *Going with a competitor: by introducing new information to reopen discussions*

7. Close

*Salespeople need to be able to get past the final line:*
- *Decision to buy*
- *Financial approval*
- *Legal approval*
- *Final signature*
- *Transition into customer getting value from product*

### Salesperson Customer Lifecycle
1. Salesperson uses free features of Crunchbase while searching for prospects or researching prospects and leads

*Users might want search results to be personalized based on past uses (note: solving this problem for users is currently behind the paywall so we’d have to consider the revenue impact of solving this problem at this stage)*

2. Salesperson signs up for a free trial of Crunchbase pro, currently the promise that Crunchbase makes is that the Pro version will help them: “Find Prospects”

*The call to action for a purchase could be personalized (either on the web page or in follow up emails etc). Maybe “Find Prospects” is not the right call to action for all salespeople. Maybe it’s “Research Leads” or “Nurture your prospects” etc.*

3. Learn to use Crunchbase pro

*Crunchbase is complex software. Crunchbase could provide an on boarding / training experience that is personalized for different users based on persona, interests, use cases, etc.*

4. See initial value from Crunchbase pro

*Personalization can help users get to value from the pro version more quickly, by surfacing better prospects (based on their stated interests, companies they click on or follow, companies that they sold to in the past, etc.). Or by surfacing other relevant product features based on use cases.*

5. Pay for Crunchbase pro

*No obvious personalization opportunity here, since the payment amount, structure, methods, and path are probably better to be consistent across users.*

6. Use Crunchbase pro

*See B2B sales cycle above.*

7. Convert to Crunchbase enterprise

*Based on activity, industry, size of company, etc. Crunchbase can recommend a switch to the Enterprise version. Furthermore, this is an eat your own dog food opportunity for Crunchbase to use it’s own B2B sales tools.*

8. Setup Crunchbase enterprise

*CB could suggest integration opportunities based on their company size, vertical, usage, etc.*

9. Use Crunchbase enterprise

*See B2B sales cycle above.*

10. Become a marketing example for Crunchbase

*Companies that haven’t had good PR recently, or alternatively companies that have competitors that with good PR recently, can use a case study with Crunchbase to gain good PR. With personalization we can surface this as an opportunity for people (maybe not in the application UI, but instead through a sales rep call). This could be a case of “eating our own dog food” as well, since we could perhaps use our own B2B sales tools to perform this analysis.*

This is a list of 31 potential pain points. Instead of going through each one, a high-level roadmap might look like this:
1. Tackle B2B Sales cycle first, since many of the salesperson lifecycle items can be addressed by good design, CB customer service or sales people.
2. Progress down the B2B sales cycle starting with Step 1 (“Finding Prospects”) and moving toward Step 7, since the higher levels of the sales cycle (funnel) have higher numbers. I.e. there are more companies and people in step 1 of a salesperson’s funnel than in step 4 of their funnel. Because there are more companies and people in those earlier steps, the targeted data from personalization in CB will be more expensive to replace with something like manual research. This might not be a perfect analysis but I think it’s a reasonable general guideline.

## Potential Solutions for “Finding Prospects”
Let’s look at potential solutions for the pain points in one of the steps of the the sales cycle: “Finding prospects”.

### Find prospects
Display, or rank higher in searches, relevant prospects based on:

#### Companies similar to ones they are interested in

Potential solutions:
- Companies similar to “X” company that they searched for, clicked on, or followed (similarity could be based on distance in a vector space, unsupervised clustering, correlation of clicks or follows)
- Unsupervised clustering of search filters and showing people new search filter possibilities
- ”Discover weekly” similar to Spotify’s discover weekly except instead of taking in user playlists as inputs, take in sales prospecting lists as inputs

#### Companies similar to ones they’ve sold to in the past

Potential solutions:
- Other companies that successfully sold to companies like “Company X” also sold to: “Company Y”, “Company Z”, etc. (kind of like Amazon’s people who bought “Product X” also bought...)
- Highlight verticals, company sizes, etc. that are common between numerous companies you sold to
- Not exactly addressing this pain point, but maybe related: A person you sold to in the past moved companies to company Y

#### Their stated interests, industry, business, etc.

Potential solutions:
- People similar to you also follow (surface in initial follow suggestions, surface in later follow suggestions, surface in search bar)
- People similar to you tried these search filters (note: is this “creepy” i.e. are we sharing info that people don’t want shared?)
- People similar to you use these product features

| Solution | Pros | Cons | Baseline algorithm (to compare more advanced algorithms against) |
|-|-|-|-|
| Companies similar to “X” | -Lots of data -Almost immediately useful | -Many different ways to solve this, could take a lot of tuning | Pearson correlation based on follows |
| Clustering of search filters | -Each recommended search filter outputs many prospects | -Messy data -Algorithm not intuitive | k-Means cluster w/ ordinal search filters |
| ”Discover weekly” | -Highly personalized | -Creep factor -Legal issues? | List of companies clicked on = “playlist” |
| Other companies that sold to... also sold to | -Most relevant -Cuts out lots of noise | -Creep factor -Legal issues? | KNN on graph where sales are edges |
| Commonalities in companies you sold to | -Helps create better search filters | -Might have noticed these already | Rank common filters by count + Bag of Words analysis |
| Person you sold to in the past  | -Directly actionable | -Might not occur that often | Alert |
| People like you also follow | -Immediately usable -Helps onboard users | -Might be noisy | Match users by same industry, loc. job, etc. |
| People like you search for | -Immediately usable -Helps onboard users | -Not a lot of data, might be bad guess | Match users by same industry, loc. job, etc. |
| People like you use this | -Immediately usable -Helps onboard users | -Not a lot of data, but bad guess not as bad | Match users by same industry, loc. job, etc. |

Based on this analysis, I would think good places to start would be:
1. Companies similar to “X”: begin design work, begin building and testing models for this
2. People like you use this: get designs of what feature highlighting would look like, get training data to determine “suggested features”, get an idea of how accurate our feature suggestions would be
3. Investigate legality and creepiness of Other companies that sold to: draw up wireframes show to people and see if they get suspicious of privacy

Note about a weakness in this analysis: it does not account for which features should go in the “Pro” vs. “Enterprise” versions, nor which version should be prioritized.
