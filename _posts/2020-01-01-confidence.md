Basketball taught me what confidence is. In 2018 I wrote for a living. This meant I sat a lot, thinking. Two activities got me out of my chair and out of my head: basketball and cooking.

As a goal for basketball, I wanted to get better at shooting. Among the things I learned from practicing my shot was the definition of confidence. When you're learning to shoot, one of the things you're told to the point of cliche is "shoot with confidence." Bradley Beal one of the best shooters in the NBA says that shooting is [80% confidence and 20% mechanics](https://youtu.be/sIZ-kUD2CDc?t=79).

When I heard people talk about confidence it always felt vague. Then, while watching Steph Curry talk about shooting he gave an instruction to "imagine the ball going in when you shoot it." Although the instruction felt handwavy, it was specific. In the following few days I tried it on the court.

The instruction was harder than it initially seemed. If I was going through the motions while on the court it was easy to drift mentally. If I was practicing, it was easy to want to focus on whatever it was that I wanted to practice (starting low, finishing high, jumping with control). If I was nervous about making a certain kind of mistake my mind would want to imagine how I might miss it. If I had missed the last shot, it was easy to want to replay that. If I was playing in a game it was easy to want to focus on my opponent and not on the hoop.

Why is it important to imagine the ball going through the hoop? Back when I was in college I had a job fundraising for an environmental non-profit. The mechanics of the job were similar to doing door to door sales. Every morning we would practice with each other before heading out. *Knock, Knock* "Hi my name is Kenan. I'm from Environment California..."

New fundraisers were nervous to hear no, they always wanted to practice how to navigate objections. Seemed sensible enough, if we learned to handle the "No"s better we might be able to turn some of them to "Yes"es. Turns out this was a pretty bad strategy overall. On the days that we practiced objection handling, we always did worse that day. Hearing "No"s all morning got us to expect "No"s when we were out there. The best practice was when we practiced saying the standard script we were all given and then hearing a simple "Yes" all morning long.

Why is confidence important? I have three guesses.

1. We can't help but become what we practice. Studies have shown that athletes who practice performing some task [in their imagination](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/sports/olympics/olympians-use-imagery-as-mental-training.html) get the same benefits of actually practicing that task. If we practice success in our minds we could be preparing the parts of our mind required for that success.

2. Any complex task requires a long process of learning skills, integrating skills, and maximizing our skills. One of the most important things we can do to facilitate this learning, integration and resourcefulness is to always have the end in mind. When we do so we can use our imagination to identify the individual skills we need to complete our task. We can also imagine how our new skills fit into the task at hand. Finally, by having the end state it mind we can imagine how our current skills can be utilized in resourceful ways to get what we want. Confidence, the habitual activity of imagining success, means that we have taught ourselves to keep the end in mind consistently.

3. A key to accessing peak performance is being unself-conscious, when we are playing "out of our minds." This is colloquially and increasingly technically known as the state of flow. Some artists can be quite insecure, the opposite of confident. That insecurity may even contribute to their creativity, pushing them to improve. Yet, when they create they are unself-conscious. Through discipline and practice they can access the unself-conscious state. Confidence might contribute to being unself-conscious, and for this reason be important. I noticed personally during shooting practice that if I became anxious about the future my muscles would often tense up and I would shoot the ball too hard, if I became down about past misses I would lose power and shoot the ball too soft. Maybe confidence is a way of keeping the mind and body loose so that flow can happen.

When we see confidence in people it's magnetic and, if we believe it, contagious. Those who are confident are often confident because their imagination has conformed to repeated real-life success. We know that the confident are generally successful, and having the successful on your side helps you. But we donâ€™t have to rely solely on real-life success to gain confidence, we can practice it. And the benefit of confidence is not only imagined.
