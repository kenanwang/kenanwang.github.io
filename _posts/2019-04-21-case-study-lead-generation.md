### Need
Wellness company in New York that sold personal growth courses. This office was one of the more successful offices but their revenue seemed to come in waves. The problem was that the sales team lacked discipline around lead generation. When leads were plenty the team focused on closing. When leads dried up they refocused efforts into lead generation. Lead generation only got attention when it was a “problem”.

### Approach
When I took over as General Manager I split the team apart so that some sales people focused on closing customers and building long term relationships, while other sales people focused on generating new leads and the initial stages of developing a relationship with a customer. Additionally, I built out new metrics tracking lead generation efforts breaking into lead generation events scheduled, RSVPs, partnership contacts made, and referrals asked for.

### Benefit
Over three months our team went from the #3 office globally in revenue to #1. Our head of lead generation developed best practices which became the standard for other offices in SF, London, and LA.

### Lessons Learned:
* Financial analysis showed us that while the best lead generators were not as important to the company’s bottom line as the best sales people, there was not as big of a gap as previously imagined. This analysis shifted how I divided my attention on the team.
* Metrics for new initiatives require substantial analytical attention. Management needs to be hands on in establishing and evaluating initial standards as well as rates of growth.
* Management needs to balance personal involvement with giving employees ownership over new initiatives. This balance can be struck by channeling management attention into higher and higher articulation of “what” should be done, while employees focus on “how” to achieve “what” the manager wants.
