Getting first customers is commendable; however, having customers and being cash flow positive are two different things. To go from having your first customers to having a solvent business is a complex problem. To resolve that complexity there are three areas that almost any company needs help with: systems, metrics, and financial control.

Systems are all about reducing guesswork. As GM of my first office, in Philadelphia, we were always guessing where our sales were going to come from. We had a CRM, and we had leads. But what we lacked was a systematic way of cultivating leads, if we ran out of potentials we scrambled. In order to fix this we replaced our old paper sign in process with an electronic sign in process. This insured that every new customer was entered into the CRM not just the most promising ones. Then we implemented two things 1) a four week calling plan to cultivate leads 2) a shift in strategy from “selling now” to one that encouraged repeat visits. Over one year, membership increased 280%, revenue increased 85%.

Most companies talk about metrics, but they don’t take them seriously. When I took over as GM of my second office, in New York, we had ebbs and flows of revenue. One month sales would be easy the next month leads would dry up. The problem was our lead generation effort was inconsistent. In months where sales were flowing and lead generation wasn't as pressing attention would drift. After I analyzed the problem we needed a plan. Planning required us to reverse engineer from what we wanted to what we could control. We couldn't control the number of leads, tracking that would increase anxiety but not productivity. What we could control was: number of partnership contracts, lead generation events planned and completed, effort toward RSVPs for events, and referral calls made. So, that's what we tracked. When something dipped I followed up. If something was consistently low we brainstormed to create new solutions. Over two months we went from the number three sales office globally to number one, a position we held for seven of the next ten months.

Any company knows that it can’t survive without cash. Systems and metrics will help you run and grow the company, but even companies with growth can be crunched for cash. Every month can be a mystery, it doesn’t have to be. The key is properly using all three financial reports. In my second GM position we were selling $3M+/yr but still struggled with cash. The first step was using our cash flow to build a 60 day forecast, this meant we always at least knew to keep our heads above water. The second step was to use our income statement to adjust prices, build sales targets, and build budgets; doubling our margins. The third step was to use the balance sheet to bridge the gap between profitability and solvency; understanding this gave the business stability, helped adjust our AP and AR policies, and gave our creditors confidence.

Systems, metrics, and control of cash is what startup operations is about. Good operations can be the difference between a temporarily interesting company, and a functional one.
