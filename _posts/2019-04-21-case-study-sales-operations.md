**Need**
Wellness company in Philadelphia that sold personal growth courses. The office had periods of success but was was inconsistent. The problem was that the office was perpetually cash strapped and was thus constantly focused on closing or finding the next prospect. However, the majority of customers who were potential, but not immediate, prospects received little attention. The company had a “leaky bucket” problem.

**Approach**
When I took over as General Manager I instituted a new metric to address the leaky bucket problem. In addition to tracking revenue we tracked repeat customers. Even if a customer didn’t buy from us immediately, if we could get them to return we considered that a type of success. In order to more accurately track this metric we instituted electronic instead of paper sign in processes. Additionally, I built processes and call scripts to reengage customers and progress a sales process.

**Benefit**
Over one year we increased membership by 285% and we increased revenue by 85%. The company also became reliably cash flow positive.

**Lessons Learned:**  
* Go for easy wins. Simply by exposing repeat customers who hadn’t been converted yet, potential prospects were unearthed that would have been overlooked in the past. This generated interest in the metric.
* Involving key players early on. Initial call scripts lacked sophistication in separating hot leads from simply warm leads. Because of this a key sales person lacked buy-in with the process, and dollars were left on the table unnecessarily.
* Sales people ought to aim to identify not generate interest. No amount of relationships building will create interest where there is none. Getting to real motivations helps both the prospect and the company.
