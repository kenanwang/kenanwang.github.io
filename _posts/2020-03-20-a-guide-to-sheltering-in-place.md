CA was just put into sheltering in place. That means we can only leave the house for essential purposes. For the last year and a half I was traveling in Bali, Morocco, and the country of Georgia. Oddly, I'm finding that traveling and sheltering in place require some of the same principles: self-reliance, managing a life with more freedom, and dealing with more social distance. Here are some battle-tested resources and principles that I used while traveling, which I'm finding are translating well to my sheltering in place.

## Exercise
- Strength: with no equipment you can do bodyweight exercises. The sub-reddit for bodyweight fitness is superb. If you want something that requires no extra thought or prep, do the “Move” program. Otherwise to keep up and increase strength, do the “Recommended Routine”, which will require some investment of thought. Here is the place to start:

- Cardio: exercise and fresh air are considered essential activities by CA during our Shelter in Place. Just keep 6 ft of distance. One thing you can do outside is run. There is a well respected 9 week program to go from couch potato to 5k.

- Flexibility: If you really want to increase your flexibility, you need a dedicated stretching program. But a good way to get a mix of some static stretching, some dynamic stretching, and some range of motion exercise is Yoga. Yoga with Adriene provides a superb free at home yoga YouTube channel. She’s approachable, and her sequences are good:

## Cooking
If you want to know the basics of cooking well, there are three resources I will give you. In decreasing cost:
- Thomas Keller’s Masterclass teaches you how to cook. Not just recipes. He’s a legend for a reason - meticulous, intelligent, quietly passionate.

- Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat. Teaches you how to think about cooking. Again not just recipes. The concept is simple - there are four variables every culture uses to transform food - salt, fat, acid, heat. Mastering these four variables is a kin to being a good cook. Also, well written and warm.

- The Pro Home Cook’s online videos are approachable, practical, and joyful. Also, free.

## Work
- Dress like you would to go to the office. I used to do this for phone interviews - dress for them as if they could see me. It made all the difference. You act differently when you make yourself purposely presentable. The principle is the same for working from home.
- Keep regular work hours. Too much freedom overwhelms us people. Without some discipline we tend toward either laziness (human nature), or anxiety (because we don’t know when our work ought to start and end).
- Write a daily or weekly report to your boss. If you are your own boss, write it for yourself. There is nothing I know to better clarify your thinking about what is and is not important, what is and is not done, what you do and don’t know; than a written report. The act of thinking “out loud” on paper creates intelligence. If you every feel fuzzy about what to do next. This is the solution. If you find yourself resisting this because you don’t like that feeling of being observed, more likely than not your thinking isn’t clear, that’s why you hide. This is the best time to write out your priorities, progress, and questions.

## Social
- If you start to have more negative thinking than usual, this is a good sign you’re not having enough social contact. It’s easy to think that things are getting worse. But actually we are social creatures. When we have less social contact the brain responds by telling us we’re in higher levels of risk. Thus, the stress of unsolved problems is equally responsive to increasing socializing, as it is from problem solving.  
- If socializing isn’t helping your stress, there’s a good chance you aren’t talking to the right people. The right people are people you trust and have enough rapport with to be honest.  This might mean you need to build trust and rapport. If you don’t trust anyone, there’s a good chance you need to learn to be assertive (not dominating, assertive). In the absence of appropriate assertiveness, you won’t trust anyone to be sensitive enough for you. If you lack rapport, know that building rapport is almost always awkward. The critical difference between social people and non-social people, is the social people keep going.
