CA was just put into sheltering in place, meaning we can only leave the house for essential purposes. I've noticed, oddly, that the last year and a half of traveling I did before this has prepared me for sheltering in place. Instead of getting a gym membership, for example, I learned to work out at home. Downstairs from my apartment in Tbilisi, Georgia you could find me in the mornings doing pull ups, push ups, and stretches. When it got dusty downstairs from construction next door, I took my workouts indoors.

## Exercise
- Strength: with no equipment you can do bodyweight exercises. Reddit has a [community dedicated to bodyweight fitness](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/index) which has superb content. They have a wiki, you can ask questions, search for answers, share or see progress, and they have a number of pre-made programs. If you want something that requires no extra thought or prep, do their “Move” program. Otherwise to keep up and increase strength, do the “Recommended Routine”, which will require some investment of training.
- Cardio: exercise and fresh air are considered essential activities by CA during our Shelter in Place, thus allowable reasons to leave the house. Just keep 6 ft of distance. Doing 10k steps a day burns 2000 - 3500 calories a week. Regularly walking has been shown to increase life spans. Most smartphones nowadays can track steps. When I was traveling, my partner and I would compete who was walking more. I think the most her and I did was close to 30k during our one day in Brussels. If you can't do 10k do 8k, or 5k.
- Flexibility: If you really want to increase your flexibility, you need a dedicated stretching program. But Yoga is a good way to get a mix of some static stretching, dynamic stretching, range of motion exercise, and relaxation. [Yoga with Adriene](https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene/videos) provides a superb free at home yoga YouTube channel. Even in Bali, the land of a thousand yoga studios, sometimes my friends and I would stay home for Yoga (like if a rain storm happened). She’s approachable, and her sequences are good:

## Cooking
Really, I learned to cook during the two years in NY when I was writing professionally. I needed something to do that would get me in my body and out of my head. But while in Bali, my friend got food poisoning a couple times and was nervous about eating, so I started cooking for her.
Cooking while traveling is much easier if you know, not just a few recipes but some principles of how to cook. Same thing seems to be holding true now, when the shelves don't always have exactly what you want. Following that principle, here are some resources in decreasing cost:
- [Thomas Keller’s Masterclass](https://www.masterclass.com/classes/thomas-keller-teaches-cooking-techniques/) teaches you how to cook. Not just recipes. He’s a legend for a reason - meticulous, intelligent, quietly passionate.
- [Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat](https://www.amazon.com/Salt-Fat-Acid-Heat-Mastering-ebook/dp/B01HMXV0UQ/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) teaches you how to think about cooking. Again not just recipes. The concept is simple - there are four variables every culture uses to transform food - salt, fat, acid, heat. Mastering these four variables is akin to being a good cook. Also, well written, warm, and humorous.
- The [Pro Home Cook](https://www.prohomecooks.com/)’s online videos are approachable, practical, and joyful. Also, free.

## Work
While traveling much of my work in Bali and Morocco was remote. In Georgia I was doing consulting, which was all remote. Here is some advice, which might be counter to what you would like:
- Dress like you would to go to the office. When I was in college, I interviewed for Teach for America. I dressed in a suit even though it was a phone interview, it made a difference. I've kept the same habit for all my phone interviews since. We act differently when we make ourselves purposely presentable. The principle is the same for working from home.
- Keep regular work hours. Too much freedom overwhelms us people. Without some discipline we tend toward either laziness (human nature), or anxiety (because we don’t know when our work ought to start and end). During the last six months of traveling I was doing therapeutic writing, and teaching myself Machine Learning. Although I wasn't answering to specific people, I treated it almost like a job going, to a [cafe](https://www.facebook.com/coffeelabgeorgia/photos/a.932061773593423/1722030187929907/?type=3&theater) or a working space from 9-5, Monday through Saturday, taking a break on Sundays.
- Write a daily or weekly report to your boss. If you are your own boss, write it for yourself. Nothing clarifies your thinking better about what is and is not important, what is and is not done, what you do and don’t know; than a written report. The act of thinking “out loud” on paper creates intelligence. If you every feel fuzzy about what to do next. This is the solution. If you find yourself resisting this because you don’t like that feeling of being observed, more likely than not your thinking isn’t clear, that’s why you hide. This is the best time to write out your priorities, progress, and questions.

## Social
One of the unexpected parts of traveling is how lonely it could be, especially when I was by myself for the last few months. You have to strive to meet people or purposely keep connection via text/phone. It's a big part of why I came back to the states six months ago. Also, at the time I was going through a big transition, and that emotionally compounded with being alone. Certainly, I learned how important social contact is. Here are some thoughts:
- When I would have less friendship in my life, I'd notice myself just getting more and more stressed and my thinking would get more negative. Usually I assume negative thinking is a sign that things are getting worse. I'd often have to remind myself (after forgetting) how much humans (of which I am one...) are social creatures. So much so that when we have less social contact our brains respond by telling us we’re at more risk. The stress of unsolved problems is, thus, often equally responsive to increased social contact, as it is to problem solving.
- If the talking you're doing isn’t helping your stress, there’s a good chance you aren’t talking to the right people. The right people are people you trust and have enough rapport with to be honest.  This might mean you need to build trust and rapport. Welcome to the club.
If you don't have these kind of people in your life, here's what I'll say. If there's something I've learned from spirituality it's that if I'm the common denominator, choosing the option of believing that it's everyone else's fault, usually just leads me to hating. What's helped me with trust? [Learning to be assertive](https://www.amazon.com/Assertiveness-Workbook-Express-Yourself-Relationships/dp/1572242094) is one thing. In the absence of appropriate assertiveness, I don’t trust anyone to be sensitive enough for me. In terms of rapport, here's what I've learned from the last couple years, and also from being around some extremely social people: the critical difference between social people and non-social people, is the social people don't get frozen by inevitable social awkwardness. I found in the last few months quite sensitive to it myself. I noticed that part of it was that it became second nature to think that social awkwardness was my fault. With some distance I often realized that the awkwardness was just accidental. Remembering that lesson nowadays lets me move through that awkwardness more easily.
- Humor is good. Right now I have a text thread going with some friends of mine. A lot of what we post are jokes or memes about the quarantine. Few things melt stress and seems to connect us in a way that is underneath words, more effectively and broadly than humor.
