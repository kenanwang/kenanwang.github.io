California was just put into sheltering in place, meaning we can only leave the house for essential purposes. I’ve noticed, oddly, that the last year and a half of traveling I did before this has prepared me for sheltering in place. Instead of getting a gym membership, for example, I learned to work out at home. Downstairs from my apartment in Tbilisi, Georgia you could find me in the mornings doing pull ups, push ups, and stretches. When it got dusty downstairs from construction that started up next door, I took my workouts inside.</p>

I’m late to the competition (there are 6 days left in a 3 month compeition). But the competition was interesting. I ended up ranking 152/1240 = 12%. I spent my time trying to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Understand the data and the problem, since I am particularly interested in NLP problems this competition attracted me and I know that by understanding the problem and the data I can be better prepared for future NLP problems</li>
  <li>Apply the Google baseline model as well as possible (Google published a model that had results that would have been good enough to rank in around the top 10% so I knew this would be a reasonable path to good results in 6 days)

        </h3><p>Most products need good documentation - FAQs, “how to”s, explanatory documents. But if your product is heavily reliant on documentation you could stand to improve the usability of your product. New users should especially be saved from reading lots of documentation. Editing Wikipedia is a fairly complex process, it requires learning certain mechanics and a new culture. Bringing new users on board (on-boarding) means thinking through what information to present when, how to be understood, and how to engage the user.

        </h3><p>At the Wikimedia Foundation we had a major success in my department during my time there. For years the most pressing issue was a decline in the number of active editors, people who edited 5 or more times in a month. As many of you know, Wikipedia is crowdsourced, so it is these editors who create the articles on Wikipedia. Since the end of 2007 that number had been going down.

The didn’t know how to distribute, secure, and administer their applications, in short they didn’t know how to manage their applications.

It allows you to find the number of games since 2013 where the game situation (game differential and time elapsed in the game) defined in the WHERE statement of the main query (found after the common table expressions) has happened. It also tells you how often the home team won in those games.

1- Find the most important terms. The way I will do this is by looking at a person’s tweet as a network of interrelated words. If the words occur in a tweet together I’ll consider them interrelated. Then I’ll use mathematical analysis of this network to tell me which words are the most important. Mathematically this kind of analysis on networks is done by calculating Centrality.<br />
2- Perform Sentiment Analysis on the terms, looking for what they speak positively or negatively about.<br />

The goal is to predict the revenue of movies based on some metadata that has been recorded for the movies including: number of ratings, IMDB ratings, social media stats, the director, the genre. Using this data, ensemble decision trees were able to produce reasonable results, predicting movie revenue to within $24M, but short of the win condition established at the start of the project.

        </h3><p>Companies must make decisions about what to build in their products and what not to build. What allows for good decisions? Memory, communication, learning feedback, and direction. When a team and a product are small enough the team implicitly and organically remembers all the relevant experiences, speaks the same language, hears the same feedback, and moves in the same direction. But when either the team or the product grow past a certain stage memory has to be recorded to be shared, language must be pruned to be useful, feedback must be sought and delivered, direction has to be discussed.
