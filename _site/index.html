            Build a Neural Net
          </a>
        </h3><p>This is an implementation of a simple neural net on toy data using only numpy for linear algebra. There is one hidden layer of neurons and thus two layers of synapses. It uses backpropogation to train the synapse weights. Thanks to Siraj Raval who showed this simple implementation on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3l4qz76JhQ">YouTube</a>.</p>

        </h3><p>This is a SQL query on the public BigQuery Database located <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/ncaa-bb-public/ncaa-basketball">here</a>. It allows you to find the number of games since 2013 where the game situation (game differential and time elapsed in the game) defined in the WHERE statement of the main query (found after the common table expressions) has happened. It also tells you how often the home team won in those games.</p>

            Enron Anomaly Detection using Neural Network Analysis
          </a>
        </h3><p>In this project I am replicating analysis from a research paper found below. This project maps a social network as a neural network, precisely a Hopfield memory network. We feed the Hopfield memory network features that represent anomalously high amounts of activity. We use a Hebbian learning rule to train our memory network. The Hebbian rule “remembers” nodes that fire together.  Thus, our memory network algorithm takes the input data of individuals who are displaying elevated activity, and extracts an even more precise signal of specific subnetworks of elevated activity occurring together.</p>

            Twitter Terms Analysis of Centrality and Sentiment
          </a>
        </h3><p>My goal will be be to use the Twitter API to import tweets related to a user or a hashtag. I will use Bag of Words (BOW) to create features on this data. Because more information is contained in terms than individual words I’ll perform this analysis on bigrams not individual words. From these BOW features, also called terms, I will perform two analyses:<br />
1) I will find the most important terms. The way I will do this is by modeling the terms in a network with the terms as networks and co-occurence in tweets as edges. I’ll then look for the terms with the highest centrality.<br />
2) I will perform Sentiment Analysis on the terms.</p>

            IMDB 5000 Revenue Regression
          </a>
        </h3><p>This project applies Machine Learning to an IMDB database of 5000 movies. The goal is to predict the revenue of a movie at a level that is helpful to a studio. To define a metric for this project I will estimate profit margin for the movies. This will be done assuming that the total budget for a movie can be estimated by doubling the production budget of that movie<sup>1</sup>. I will find the standard deviation of profit margin for the movies in this dataset and attempt to predict revenue to within 1/4 of that standard deviation. The reason for this win condition is that I believe it would be helpful for movie executives to prevent the worst loses in their portfolio and also avoid underbudgeting strong performers.</p>
