Chase hard problems. Keep asking "why".

**Driven to understand the whys (users, customers, strategy):** at Bearing developed product strategy to gain traction in a conservative industry, at Wikipedia rewrote roadmap based on quantitative and qualitative usage analysis

**Technical:** at Hive Media Group coded a python prototype that used reinforcement learning to optimize ad settings then pair-programmed with the implementation engineer to launch it, I can hold my own in discussions ranging from generative AI to multi-platform development

**Leader who delivers results:** at Bearing reduced customer complaints by improving product health, at Wikipedia increased usage on mobile which was important to turning around the decline of active editors
