I lead innovative (0-1) AI and data products to solve complex, valuable problems in B2B companies. This requires:
- Collaborating closely with technical experts during creative stages
- Aligning product decisions with company capabilities and unique value propositions
- Intuiting customer needs combined with the discipline to rigorously test assumptions
These are capabilities I’ve built and demonstrated atop a foundation of dedication, intelligence, and empathy.

I’m passionate about working in high-growth environments where AI and data products/platforms address real-world challenges and help companies maintain a competitive edge. In healthcare, for example, Baumol’s Cost Disease drives rising costs—and AI offers a rare chance to bend this curve.
